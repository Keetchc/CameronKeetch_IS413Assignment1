        <p>
            I am really excited for the IS 413 class. I have really enjoyed all of the other programming courses that I have taken, and am excited to continue to learn how to code.
            I don't know exactly what I want to get out of this class, but I am excited to try using a language and technology that is different from Python and Django. In the limited job interviews
            that I have had there have been questions about programming principles that would have been easier to understand with a knowledge of a strongly typed language. I am also excited
            to learn more about security, and how ASP.NET and REACT can better help programmers work in a team.
